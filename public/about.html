    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer with speciality in cloud devops and site reliability,
      I proficienty use languages like JS, Python and Go to build, scale and maintain 
      backend and cloud infrastructures. 

      I like working with teams that are building something new and novel, I beleive environments like
      that provdides unique challenges and affords me the breadth to take creative liberties.

      When I am not in front of my screen, I'm eiter reading books, watching a 90's movies, writing my own 
      book or curled up with my lover.
